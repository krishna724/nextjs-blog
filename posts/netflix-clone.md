I have implemented a clone of Netflix a web app which I built from scratch using ReactJS. I have used [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API's to get the movies information. And hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) a very nice and easy way to host your simple webapp. Just for fun I have implemented this. you can check the live one [here](https://netflix-clone-bala.web.app/)

The functionalities I have added:
1. you can watch only the movie trailer from youtube(by using react-youtube npm package I have achieved this)
2. You can see the list of movies and documentaries.
3. You can't watch entire movie ;)

Here is the the [github repo](https://github.com/krishna724/netflix-clone-bala). If any one of wish to contribute please do so.

How to run this app in your local:
1. [Clone the project](https://github.com/krishna724/netflix-clone-bala)
2. Run npm i install all the reqired dependencies
3. run npm start(Runs the app in the development mode.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
